Hi all, this is @minhaj-ap .
In this project i have completed a todo-app. Users can create their todo, delete it and edit it.
Unlike other todos this app support various users. I used firebase authentication for it.
This app is working on firestore as it's database . Users can add their data,edit their data, mark their data , update value fo their data and Delete it.
Due to the lck of flexibility of firestore ro deal with arrays in a document, i am forced to use setDoc every time such as updating data and adding data.
This project is done in the simplest way,maybe not the best effective one. Hope it's helpful. Thank you.
